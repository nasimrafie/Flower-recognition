# Flower-recognition
I developed a deep learning model using TensorFlow to recognize and classify five different types of flowers: roses, sunflowers, dandelions, daisies, and tulips. The model is trained on image data to accurately differentiate between these flowers, providing a reliable solution for flower classification tasks.
